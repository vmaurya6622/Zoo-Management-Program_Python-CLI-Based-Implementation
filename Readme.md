Hello, in this maven project, I have Implemented a zoo administration program that runs seamlessly.
it provides all the important options that were provided by the assignment description pdf.

The code works fine with Maven, I have also updated the pom.xml file

Procedures To run the code :-
0. open IntellijIdea Ide.
1. go to src\main\java\org\example\Main.java
2. then on right-side of your screen click on maven.
3. now click on clean
4. now click on package (i have updated [pom.xml] so it will not throw error).
5. a new folder named target will be made automatically.go to that folder and run (by right clicking) the .jar file.
6. it will run as per the guidelines with the same instruction sets.
7. there is error handling also at every case (i have given full effort so that program cannot throw any exception and exit)
8. you can also read to get the dependencies (junit v-3.8.1)that i have used.

Thank you. :-)
